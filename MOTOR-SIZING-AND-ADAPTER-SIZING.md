# MOTOR SIZING
## 1.Motor used in Striking the Striker
Vertical Force, F=mg

where mass, m=0.0141 Kg

acceleration due to gravity, g=9.8 m/s^2

therefore, F=0.1382 N

Torque, T=Fr

where perpendicular, r=4.572 cm

therefore T=0.6318 Kg-cm

safety factor=1.5

this implies, T=0.9478 Kg-cm

Therefore the rated rpm of geared DC motor at 12V will be 150 rpm

## 2. Motor used in Moving the Bot
Load Torque, T=FD/2n

Force, F=Fa+mg(sin(theta)+fcos(theta))

where, external applied force, Fa=2.205 N

total mass of load, m=1.5 Kg

diameter of pulley, D=2 cm

acceleration due to gravity, g=9.8 m/s^2

angle of inclination, theta= 0 radian

driving efficiency, n=0.9

coefficient of friction, f=0.15

therefore, T=4.9 Kg-cm

safety factor=1.5

this implies, T=7.35 Kg-cm

Therefore the rated rpm of geared DC motor at 12V will be 30 rpm

## 3. Motor used in Angle Adjustment
Vertical Force, F=mg

where mass, m=0.2123 Kg

acceleration due to gravity, g=9.8 m/s^2

therefore, F=2.0805 N

Torque, T=Fr

where perpendicular distance, r=7 cm

therefore, T=14.5635 Kg-cm

Therefore, the estimated torque of stepper motor is 14 Kg-cm

 Safety factor=1.5

So, Total torque=21.845 kg-cm

Therefore the rated rpm of geared DC motor at 12V will be 30 rpm

# ADAPTER SIZING

DC motor=2

load current=300mA

Total load current=300mA*2=600mA

safety factor= 1.2 = 600*1.2 = 720mA = 0.72A

therefore adapter required = 0.72A @ 12v.
